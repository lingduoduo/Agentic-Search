# Search engine

[← Back to README](../README.md)

This guide covers the search agent: what it can do and how the web API routes a
request into it. For the authoritative deep dives, see
[API request routing](request-routing.md) and [Retrieval](retrieval.md).

## Capabilities

- **Agentic RAG** — multi-turn search with query enhancement, citations, and
  grounded synthesis.
- **Dense, sparse, and hybrid retrieval** — RRF fusion, reranking, and query
  optimization workflows over the local corpus and indexes.
- **Web search** — Google Custom Search, SerpAPI, and browser automation as
  fall-through sources when internal retrieval is insufficient.

## Request routing

With `mode` omitted, `/api/agent` classifies each request as `chat`, `search`, or
`tool`. An unfiltered auto-routed search tries internal retrieval first; weak or
empty evidence falls through to SerpAPI and then the configured browser-search
service. If no source returns evidence, the API reports that directly instead of
asking a local model to answer from memory. See
[API request routing](request-routing.md) for modes, provider precedence,
access-filter behavior, metadata, and examples.

Searchable documents are prepared before query time by the existing asynchronous
ingestion and indexing jobs. Filter-aware and degraded search paths use the
shared composed pipeline: bounded session history resolves follow-ups for
retrieval, then candidates are ranked/reranked and used for evidence-grounded
inference. Strong unfiltered auto-search remains a distinct direct-first path: it
queries the original request, applies its direct ranking and sufficiency gate,
and falls through to SerpAPI and browser search when needed. Every path persists
finalized answers, citations, documents, and stage metadata through the same
JSON/SSE response tail. This internal simplification introduces no new public API
and does not change the request or response schemas.
